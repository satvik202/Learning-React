useEffect hook :
(named imported)

useEffect(callback Function, dependency array);  // 2 parameters
this callback function will be called after the component is rendered

So if you gotta do something after rendering the component. you have to use useEffect

useEffect allow you to perform side effects in function components.
Side effects may include data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM in React components.
