Let's get hooked!

How to export :

2 ways:

i) import default {name of the component}    // the default export --> when you need to export only one thing

ii) just write export before the variable name // named export  -> used when you need to export multiple objects from a file

import : import Header from "./components/Header";   // default import

--> never keep the hardcoded data in the components file
use the folder utils/config for that stuff

when we use named export we import stuff slightly differently
ie. whatever you're importing should be in curly braces
eg. : 
import {CDN_URL} from "../utils/constants"  // named import
