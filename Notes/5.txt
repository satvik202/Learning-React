Let's get hooked!

How to export :

2 ways:

(i) import default {name of the component}    // the default export --> when you need to export only one thing

(ii) just write export before the variable name // named export  -> used when you need to export multiple objects from a file

import : import Header from "./components/Header";   // default import

--> never keep the hardcoded data in the components file
use the folder utils/config for that stuff

when we use named export we import stuff slightly differently
ie. whatever you're importing should be in curly braces
eg. : 
import {CDN_URL} from "../utils/constants"  // named import


React hooks  --> just normal js utility functions provided by React
there are many such but 2 most important are :

(i) useState()
    ->the useState hook is used to add state to functional components.
      It allows you to declare state variables inside functional components and provides a way to update them.
    ->you need to neme import it before using it


    whenever a state variable updates react rerenders the component

    syntax :
    const [restaurant, setRestaurant] = useState(resList)  // resList will be the initial value of restaurant

    to change restaurant, you need to pass the new value in side setRestaurant--> a callback function


(ii) useEffect()


behind the scenes react uses "Reconsiliation ALgorithm" (also known as react fiber)
React creates a virtual DOM (a representation of the actual DOM)

Diff ALgoritm -> find outs the difference between two virtual DOMs  --> the updated VDOM and the previous VDOM

Why react if fast?
Because it maintains a virtual DOM. It uses an algo called "Diff Algorithm" which is very efficient for DOM manipulation
