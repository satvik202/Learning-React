Redux

redux works in the data layer

lot of places where redux are use.
redox is not mandatory. it solves props drilling
redux is a 3rd party library. not part of react (there are other libraries that can be used to manage states and data like redux as well)
(e.g zustand)

Redux is used heavily with react that's why it is very popular

redux offers 2 libraries : react-redux   & redux-toolkit

redux-toolkit is the newer way of writing redux.   Vanilla redux isn't used now


click(or other event)  --> action is dispatched -->reducer function is called which will then update the slice

component uses selectors to read the data in the slice. this is called subscribing to the store


- install @reduxjs/toolkit and react-redux
- build our own store
-connect our store to the app
- cart slice
- dispatch action (clicking the button or anything else)
-read data using selector



npm install @reduxjs/toolkit

configureStore();


import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
const appStore = configureStore({});

export default appStore;
