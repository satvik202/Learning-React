Class based components

import "React" from "react"

class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}

whenever we mount a class based component, first it's constructor is called.

1. constructor   This is called when the component is initialized. It's typically used for initializing state and binding methods.
2. render() method within the class ---> this will what the user see
   This method is called to render the component's UI. It returns the JSX that represents what the user will see.
3. componentDidMount() method ---> called after render() is done. generally used to fetch data from apis
4. componentWillUnmount() when we are unmounting the component
 This method is called just before the component is removed from the DOM.
 It's used for cleaning up any resources used by the component, such as event listeners or subscriptions.

So, in summary, the lifecycle methods mentioned are part of the React component lifecycle.
