higher order component

-> a component that takes a component (as a prop) and returns a prop

// js tip : object.card.card is same as object.card.["card"]   , let's say one key in your json is @type
   then you cannot do object.card.card.@type --> that's not the syntax
   that's where the above stuff will be used

   object.card.card.["@type"]


controlled and uncontrolled components
lifting state up
